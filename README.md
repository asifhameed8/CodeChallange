##Code Challenge Project Overview
This comprehensive project seamlessly integrates Asp .Net Core Web API version 6 with Angular version 14.2.8, combining robust backend functionality with a dynamic and responsive frontend.

##Development Server Setup
To initiate the development server, change Connection string, run migration to create database and simply run the API. Swagger, a powerful API documentation tool, is conveniently installed for seamless exploration and understanding of API endpoints.

For the frontend, execute ng serve to launch a development server. Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:4200/. The system will automatically reload upon detecting any modifications to the source files.

##Build Process
Execute ng build to compile the project. The resulting build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory, ensuring a deployable and optimized application.

##Enhanced Functionality
In addition to the core project features, this implementation introduces a secure authentication system. Users can now register and log in using JWT token authentication. Two distinct user interfaces have been crafted for enhanced user experience - one tailored for administrators and another for general users.

This project not only exemplifies the seamless integration of Asp .Net Core Web API and Angular but also extends its capabilities with thoughtful enhancements, making it a robust solution for modern web development needs.
